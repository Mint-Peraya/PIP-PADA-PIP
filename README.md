# PIP-PADA-PIP
Final project for computer programming 1, SKE KU Year 2024

This game is called "Pip pada Pip". 
Indeed, this name comes from that sound the kids' shoes made when they were walking.

To describe this project in 1 sentence, it should be "2 in 1 turtle".

Project description
This game provided 2 mini game and sign up or sign in system.

#### Mini Game: Flappy Turtle

**Flappy Turtle** is an interactive arcade game built using the `turtle` graphics library in Python. The game follows the classic "Flappy Bird" mechanics, where the player controls a turtle that must navigate through obstacles (pipes) by jumping. The player also needs collect bubbles, which increase the score.The goal is to accumulate the highest score while avoiding collisions with pipes or the screen boundaries.

### Features:

1. **Playable Character**:
   - The player controls a **turtle**, which can "jump" upwards with a spacebar to avoid obstacles.
   - The turtle is affected by gravity, which pulls it downward when no jump input is given.

2. **Obstacles**:
   - **Pipes** move from right to left across the screen, and the player must avoid them to stay alive.
   - The gap between pipes is randomized, increasing the game's difficulty.

3. **Bubbles**:
   - **Blue bubbles** appear randomly and provide bonus points when the turtle collides with them.
 
4. **Scoring**:
   - The player earns points by successfully navigating through pipes and collecting bubbles.
   - The game tracks the score and displays it on the screen.
   - If the player passes a pipe, they score a point, and they can also collect bonuses from the bubbles.

5. **Game Over**:
   - The game ends if the turtle collides with a pipe or the screen boundaries.
   - The final score is displayed, and the game can be exited.

6. **Screen Border**:
   - A visible border is drawn around the game screen to help the player gauge the boundaries and prevent the turtle from going out of bounds.

This game is fun and fast-paced, providing an enjoyable challenge for players of all ages. It incorporates basic game mechanics like gravity, collisions, and scoring to create a dynamic and interactive experience.



#### Mini Game: Turtle to go

This project is an interactive game built using Python's `turtle` module. The game challenges players to control a turtle navigating avoiding obstacles. The player needs to collect a target (represented by a green circle).The player uses the arrow keys or spacebar to move the character.

##### Features:

1. **Target Collection**:
   - The player aims to collect the target, earning points each time they successfully do so.
   - Every time the player collects the target, new obstacles appear, increasing the game's difficulty.

3. **Score System**:
   - The game keeps track of the player's level, which increases with each target collected.
   - The level decreases by 0.5 if the player collides with the red circle.

4. **Simple Controls**:
   - The player moves the turtle using the arrow keys for direction and the spacebar to move forward.
   - These controls are simple, making the game easy to pick up and play.

5. **Game Timer**:
   - The game lasts for 60 seconds or until the player reaches a level of 10, whichever comes first.

This game is a fun, casual experience with easy-to-learn mechanics, but it offers enough challenge to keep players engaged. It is an example of how simple graphics and interactive controls can create an enjoyable user experience.
